        <p>A compassionate man by the name of Spencer Call made this website to spread awareness about the issue of plastic entering into the ocean. He deeply cares about the ocean and its creatures and wants others to know what's happening. He hopes anyone who views the website will spread the word and help the ocean recover and become what it once was.</p>
